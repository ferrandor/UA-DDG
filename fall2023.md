**Title:** Optimal Path Planning in the Hamilton-Jacobi Formulation

**Abstract:** We present a partial-differential-equation-based optimal path planning framework. This formulation relies on optimal control theory, dynamic programming, and Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations, and thus provides an interpretable alternative to black-box machine learning algorithms.  We design grid-based numerical methods used to resolve the solution to the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation and generate optimal trajectories.  We then describe how efficient and scalable algorithms for solutions of high dimensional Hamilton-Jacobi equations can be used to solve similar problems in higher dimensions and in nearly real-time. We demonstrate all of our methods with several examples.

**Title:** Analyzing and Mitigating the Impacts of Grid-edge Technologies on Power Distribution Networks

**Abstract:** In this talk, we first present a new rapid estimation method (REM) to perform stochastic impact analysis of grid-edge technologies (GETs) to the power distribution networks. The evolution of network states' probability density functions (PDFs) in terms of GET penetration levels are characterized by the Fokker-Planck equation. The approach is illustrated on a large-scale, realistic distribution network using a modified version of the IEEE 8500 feeder, where electric vehicles (EVs) or photovoltaic systems are installed at various penetration rates. Second, we design an incentive-based mitigation strategy for equipment overloading leveraging the REM. The objective is to shift the EV charging during the peak hours when the equipment is overloaded to the off-peak hours and maintain equipment service lifetime. The incentive level and corresponding contributions from customers to alter their EV charging habits are determined by a search algorithm with provable convergence guarantee. The strategy is illustrated on the same IEEE 8500 feeder with a high EV penetration to mitigate overloads on the substation transformer.

**Title:** Data value and interpretability in data-driven power system operations

**Abstract:** The massive roll-out of stochastic resources (e.g., wind and solar power) in the power system complicates its operations and challenges established regulatory and economic paradigms. The resulting misfit between emerging technology and the existing systems in the power and energy industry is one of the most significant barriers towards achieving a timely decarbonization of our economy. This talk discusses options to overcome this barrier using state-of-the-art data driven decision-making approaches and computational resources. First, I will discuss the role of data and information in modern power systems. I will then discuss approaches on how data can be internalized in the energy value chain to accommodate the new role of stochastic resources. Finally, I will demonstrate how probabilistic safety guarantees can be achieved through interpretable safety parameters.

**Title:** Markov chain Monte Carlo and high-dimensional, nonlinear inverse problems in Earth Science

**Abstract:** Earth science nearly always requires estimating models, or model parameters, from data. This could mean to infer the state of the southern ocean from ARGO floats, to compute the state of our atmosphere based on atmospheric observations of the past six hours, or to construct a resistivity model of the Earth’s subsurface from electromagnetic data. All these problems have in common that the number of unknowns is large (millions to hundreds of millions) and that the underlying processes are nonlinear. The problems also all have in common that they can be formulated as the problem of drawing samples from a high-dimensional Bayesian posterior distribution.

Due to the nonlinearity, Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is a good candidate for the numerical solution of geophysical inverse problems. But MCMC is known to be slow when the number of unknowns is large. In this talk, I will argue that an unbiased solution of nonlinear, high-dimensional problems remains difficult, but one can construct efficient and accurate biased estimators that are feasible to apply to high-dimensional problems. I will show examples of biased estimators in action and invert electromagnetic data using an approximate MCMC sampling algorithm called the RTO-TKO (randomize-then-optimize -- technical-knock-out). 

## September 21, 2023

The Data and Dynamics working group would like to kick-off the semester with a second iteration of our "Question Blitz"! The "Question Blitz" is an informal event where everyone is encouraged to share some brief background about the topic(s) they are interested in, as well as what questions they would like to answer but may not know how to address. This is also a good space to present some "half baked" ideas to an audience or to advertise a paper/topic you would like the group to discuss this term. The "Question Blitz" is (tentatively) scheduled for next Thursday, Sept. 14 from 11a-12:15p** in MATH 402. 

**Please note the change to our weekly meeting time, as discussed in the organizational meeting today.



If you are planning to participate in the "Question Blitz", please fill out the [sign-up sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bupjxRbp0LOxMe-bCUItptC9CkZsOvc7p7k2_zZ6nZE/edit?pli=1#gid=0) by 5pm on Monday 9/11. If you would like to participate but will not have enough time to prepare a talk by 9/14, please let us know in the notes section of the sign-up sheet. Also see below for some general guidelines.



We hope to see and hear from you all!!



Question Blitz Guidelines: 

Time - ~3-5 min talk (3-4 min talk + time for quick questions)

Topics - Can be broad or narrow in scope, try to think about topics related to the general themes related to data & dynamics and what you would like to see this term

Visual Aids - Optional. Max of 2 slides, if any. Chalkboard talks are also welcome! (If you plan to present slides, please plan to share your materials with the organizers beforehand.) 

## September 7, 2023

We will have an organizational meeting next Thursday, September 7. If you have any topics you would like to discuss, papers you would like to study, etc., please let us know, either at the meeting or by email.
