# Welcome

Welcome the Data and Dynamics Working Group at the University of Arizona, part of our [NSF RTG in Data-Driven Discovery](https://sites.google.com/math.arizona.edu/data-driven-discovery/home?pli=1).

For the Spring 2023 semester, the seminar is co-organized by [Kevin Lin](https://www.math.arizona.edu/~klin/index.php), [Alexa Aucoin](https://appliedmath.arizona.edu/person/alexa-aucoin), [Robert Ferrando](https://appliedmath.arizona.edu/person/robert-ferrando), and [Adrienne Kinney](https://appliedmath.arizona.edu/person/adrienne-kinney).

Meetings will be held on Wednesdays from 1:00-2:00 pm, in room **TBD** and over Zoom at **TBD**. We will also host a Slack channel for offline discussion. To be added to our email list or Slack channel, please email one of the organizers.

**Title**: Spectral Estimation and Iterated Whitening

**Abstract**: The power spectrum of a stationary stochastic process characterizes the amount of “energy” in different frequencies, and power spectra are a fundamental tool in data analysis, signal processing, and linear prediction and control. Standard methods for estimating power spectra from data can be highly inaccurate when the dynamic range of the spectrum is large.  In this talk, I present a novel method for accurately estimating the power spectra of signals from data. The method, based on an iterated “whitening” procedure, is designed to work well for spectra with high dynamic range.  I compare the iterated whitening method with two standard methods, and illustrate its use on a prototypical model of spatiotemporal chaos.
