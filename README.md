# Schedule

## September 14, 2023

The Data and Dynamics working group would like to kick-off the semester with a second iteration of our "Question Blitz"! The "Question Blitz" is an informal event where everyone is encouraged to share some brief background about the topic(s) they are interested in, as well as what questions they would like to answer but may not know how to address. This is also a good space to present some "half baked" ideas to an audience or to advertise a paper/topic you would like the group to discuss this term. The "Question Blitz" is (tentatively) scheduled for next Thursday, Sept. 14 from 11a-12:15p** in MATH 402. 

**Please note the change to our weekly meeting time, as discussed in the organizational meeting today.



If you are planning to participate in the "Question Blitz", please fill out the [sign-up sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bupjxRbp0LOxMe-bCUItptC9CkZsOvc7p7k2_zZ6nZE/edit?pli=1#gid=0) by 5pm on Monday 9/11. If you would like to participate but will not have enough time to prepare a talk by 9/14, please let us know in the notes section of the sign-up sheet. Also see below for some general guidelines.



We hope to see and hear from you all!!



Question Blitz Guidelines: 

Time - ~3-5 min talk (3-4 min talk + time for quick questions)

Topics - Can be broad or narrow in scope, try to think about topics related to the general themes related to data & dynamics and what you would like to see this term

Visual Aids - Optional. Max of 2 slides, if any. Chalkboard talks are also welcome! (If you plan to present slides, please plan to share your materials with the organizers beforehand.) 

## September 7, 2023

We will have an organizational meeting next Thursday, September 7. If you have any topics you would like to discuss, papers you would like to study, etc., please let us know, either at the meeting or by email.
