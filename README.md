**Speaker:** [Andrew Arnold](https://appliedmath.arizona.edu/person/andrew-arnold)

**Title:** Missing the messy mesh mishaps

**Abstract:** In the first part of a series on the practical numerical solution of PDEs, I will present some insight on the questions of: a. What is a mesh? and b. How do we assess if a particular mesh is good for solving a problem?, largely based on the first chapter of "Delauney Mesh Generation" by Siu-Wing Cheng, et al. After this dose of theory, we'll get some hands-on experience with a tutorial on making and assessing a mesh using the open-source meshing software Gmsh. You can download the latest version at [https://gmsh.info/](https://gmsh.info/) in preparation!

**Speaker:** [Alexa Aucoin](https://appliedmath.arizona.edu/person/alexa-aucoin)

**Topic:** Granger Causality

**Abstract:**  I will give a talk on Granger Causality, a statistical test for determining "causal" relationships for time-series data. We will start with an introduction to the early definitions and applications of Granger, focusing on its assumptions and caveats. Afterwards, I will discuss recent improvements and extensions of Granger Causality using machine learning.

**Speaker:** Ziao Chen, University of Missouri

**Title:** Dimensionality Reduction in Neuroscience

**Abstract:** There has been rapid development and increasing use of technologies for recording from large numbers of neurons. It is important to study a population of recorded neurons beyond studying each neuron individually. Many recent studies have used dimensionality reduction to analyze the population activities that are not apparent at the level of individual neurons. I will discuss some dimensionality reduction methods commonly applied to population activity, starting with basic covariance methods such as principal component analysis (PCA) and factor analysis (FA). Then I will focus on a time series method called Gaussian process factor analysis (GPFA) which unifies the smoothing and dimensionality reduction operations in a common probabilistic framework and allows to apply on single-trial population activity. If time permits, I will briefly introduce other time series methods, such as latent linear/nonlinear dynamical systems.
