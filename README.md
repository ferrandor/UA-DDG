# Welcome

Welcome the Data and Dynamics Working Group at the University of Arizona, part of our [NSF RTG in Data-Driven Discovery](https://sites.google.com/math.arizona.edu/data-driven-discovery/home?pli=1).

For the Spring 2023 semester, the seminar is co-organized by
[Kevin Lin](https://www.math.arizona.edu/~klin/index.php),
[Alexa
Aucoin](https://appliedmath.arizona.edu/person/alexa-aucoin),
[Robert
Ferrando](https://appliedmath.arizona.edu/person/robert-ferrando),
and [Adrienne
Kinney](https://appliedmath.arizona.edu/person/adrienne-kinney).
See [here](https://www.math.arizona.edu/~klin/ddg) for
information on previous semesters.

Meetings will be held on Wednesdays from 1:00-2:00 pm, in room **MATH 501** and over Zoom. We will also host a Slack channel for offline discussion.

## February 1, 2023

**Question Blitz**

The Data and Dynamics Group will hold its next meeting on Wed. 2/1 @ 1pm in MATH 501. For this meeting we would like to hold an informal "Question Blitz" where everyone is invited to participate. This is an opportunity for everyone to share some brief background about the topic(s) they are interested in, as well as what questions they would like to answer but may not know how to address. This is also a good space to present some "half baked" ideas to an audience. If time permits, we will have a roundtable discussion following the blitz about any common themes that we may want to discuss further this term. 


If you think you might participate, please [sign-up](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1krjwyw24YpVYxZ6xsm4j1boaqeihLteOJ_w6ShHNoIM/edit?pli=1#gid=0) by next Tuesday 1/31 so we can get a general sense of how many talks we will have. Also see below for some general guidelines.


We hope to see and hear from you all! 


**Question Blitz Guidelines:**

* Time - Strict 4 mins (3 mins for talk, 1 for questions)
* Topics - Can be broad or narrow in scope, try to think about topics related to the general themes of data & dynamics.
* Visual Aids - Optional. Max of 2 slides, if any. Chalkboard talks are also welcome! (Please bring your own device if you plan to present slides.)

**Speaker**: [Jared McBride](https://appliedmath.arizona.edu/person/jared-mcbride)

**Title**: Spectral Estimation and Iterated Whitening

**Abstract**: The power spectrum of a stationary stochastic process characterizes the amount of “energy” in different frequencies, and power spectra are a fundamental tool in data analysis, signal processing, and linear prediction and control. Standard methods for estimating power spectra from data can be highly inaccurate when the dynamic range of the spectrum is large.  In this talk, I present a novel method for accurately estimating the power spectra of signals from data. The method, based on an iterated “whitening” procedure, is designed to work well for spectra with high dynamic range.  I compare the iterated whitening method with two standard methods, and illustrate its use on a prototypical model of spatiotemporal chaos.
